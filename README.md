This is a simple client for get and set.


# Usage

Need to deploy the contract ([kaleido-js/simplestorage.sol at master · kaleido-io/kaleido-js · GitHub](https://github.com/kaleido-io/kaleido-js/blob/master/deploy-transact/contracts/simplestorage.sol)) first by following the guide in 
[Deploy a contract - GoQuorum](https://consensys.net/docs/goquorum/en/latest/tutorials/contracts/deploying-contracts/).

Note the account address and deployed contract address. Then open `index.html` and use it there.


# Todo

-   [ ] Add HTML input validators
-   [ ] Better error handling
